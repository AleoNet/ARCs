## 1. Abstract

There are several ARC-20 implementation standard proposals for the Aleo blockchain. This ARC provides a complete token standard for both public and private account/contract operations. Compared to other ARC-20 proposals this ARC has the following major differences:
1. Replaced onchain `approve()` functionality with [offchain signature](#tp) - `approve()` transition should not be implemented, instead user can agree to send token to a contract offchain using an offchain signature process to approve a transaction, and an onchain function eg [`transfer_from_public()`](#tp) that can apply that signature. This way smart contract interaction does not have to be a two step, but rather a one step process. This solution will save system resources as the approve part is offchain rather than onchain.
2. Enable [private token records to be sent to smart contracts](#deposit_private) - This problem must be addressed because one of the key selling points of Aleo is its programmable privacy. The author of this ARC also believes that to utilize the UTXO nature of Token records also leads to a much larger scalability than that can be achieved applying mappings and public tokens.
3. A signature scheme that [connects the contract with the main website](#company_signature) of the project. Thus make it easier for users to trust the token contract, and decrease the possibility of phishing attacks.

By applying the proposals pointed out in this ARC the token standard will be more usable because of:
1. one step approval process applying off chain signature, instead of two steps of `approve()` and `transfer_from()`, and 
2. the ability to send private tokens to smart contracts will enable a thriving DeFi life on top of the Aleo network.
3. make token contracts more secure by connecting them to the company website applying a digital signature.

<a name="2_specification"></a>
## 2. Specification

<a name="2_1_terminology"></a>
### 2.1. Terminology

<a name="2_1_1_offline_signature"></a>
#### 2.1.1. Offline signature

In recently Aleo has introduced signature verification scheme in the snarkVM. This means that a user can sign a message offline, and then the signature can be verified onchain. This is a very important feature as it enables the user to sign a message offline, and then send the signature to the blockchain.  The signature verification is done by the snarkVM, and the signature is verified by the `signature::verify(s: signature, from: address, field_hash: field)` function. This way user can pre sign the transaction of allowing a certain amount of tokens to be transferred from his/her account to aan address.

<a name="2_1_2_must_be_implemented"></a>
#### 2.1.2. MUST BE IMPLEMENTED

If a feature is termed "MUST BE IMPLEMENTED" then it means that the feature is mandatory to be implemented to comply to this ARC. 

<a name="2_1_3_must_not_be_implemented"></a>
#### 2.1.3. MUST NOT BE IMPLEMENTED

If a feature is termed "MUST NOT BE IMPLEMENTED" then it means that the feature must NOT be implemented to comply to this ARC. Implementing this feature will lead to non-compliance to this ARC.

An implementation of the feature can lead to immediate token loss for users.

<a name="2_1_4_should_be_implemented"></a>
#### 2.1.4. SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED

If a feature is termed "SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED" then it means that the feature is not mandatory to be implemented to comply to this ARC, but it is highly recommended to be implemented. 

If the feature is indeed implemented, then it MUST BE implemented in a way described in this ARC. 

<a name="2_1_5_not_needed"></a>
#### 2.1.5. NOT NEEDED

If a feature is termed "NOT NEEDED" then it means that current ARC defines an alternative way of achieving the same functionality. 

<a name="2_1_6_not_implementable"></a>
#### 2.1.6. NOT IMPLEMENTABLE

If a feature is termed "NOT IMPLEMENTABLE" then it means that current implementation of snarkVM does not make it possible to implement the certain feature. 

<a name="2_1_7_must_be"></a>
#### 2.1.7. MUST BE

If a feature is termed "MUST BE" then it means that the feature is mandatory to be implemented accordingly to comply to this ARC. 

<a name="2_1_8_must_have"></a>
#### 2.1.8. MUST HAVE

If a feature is termed "MUST HAVE" then it means that the feature must contain something exactly the way it was defined after "MUST HAVE" was used to comply to this ARC. 

<a name="2_1_9_must"></a>
#### 2.1.9. MUST

Whatever follows "MUST", that must be implemented exactly as it was defined after "MUST" to comply with this ARC.

<a name="2_1_10_new_aleo_feature_should_be_implemented"></a>
#### 2.1.10. NEW FEATURE SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED

Aleo should implement a feature that this ARC is based upon. Implementation of the feature not crucial for the operation of this ARC, but it is highly recommended to implement it. 

If it is implemented, then it MUST BE implemented in the way described in this ARC. (Or this ARC must be updated.)

<a name="2_1_11_new_aleo_feature_must_be_implemented"></a>
#### 2.1.11. NEW FEATURE MUST BE IMPLEMENTED

Aleo must implement the feature required by this ARC. If the feature is not implemented, then this ARC can not be implemented. 

<a name="zero_address"></a>
<a name="2_1_12_zero_address"></a>
#### 2.1.12. ZERO_ADDRESS

```leo
// ZERO_ADDRESS = BHP256::hash_to_address(0group).
const ZERO_ADDRESS: address = aleo1yr9ls3d7cn2x2sr359kqq7vjkwnzr4x0e24ju6ysj2pte4c99c8qx0rwwl;
assert_eq(ZERO_ADDRESS, BHP256::hash_to_address(0group));
```

Because Aleo as at the time of the writing of this ARC does not have the Rust functionality of [Option](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/) `None`, we must introduce an address that will be treated as `ZERO_ADDRESS` is the address that is created by applying `BHP256::hash_to_address(0group)`. The function of this address is that system takes it as if no address was provided at all.

Because of hashing applied the way above, the chance of an account will have the same address as `ZERO_ADDRESS` is negligible. 


<a name="mpc"></a>
<a name="2_1_13_mpc_multi_party_computation"></a>
#### 2.1.13. MPC (Multi Party Computation)

[Multi Party Computation](https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/what-are-multi-party-computation-mpc-wallets) is a decentralized solution of storing a private key of an account in a federated way thus making it impossible for any party (even the ones that are part of the MPC) to have access to the private key.  It can be used to create wallets that can be used to store private keys for contracts. The MPC MUST HAVE the following features:
1. The private key MUST be used to sign transactions, but  MUST NOT be possible to reconstruct the private key for any parties in the MPC or outside the MPC.
2. MPC MUST BE scalable. (As the number of parties constituting the MPC is not limited, and also multiple MPC clusters can be used to store the same private key and sign transactions parallelly, this is perfectly possible). 
3. MPC implementation MUST HAVE no way to handle users' funds any other way other than that set out by the smart contracts.
4. MPC MUST store all the secret data in encrypted form. This way even if the parts of the MPC cluster is compromised, the data will be useless for the attacker.
5. Compliance SHOULD BE implemented in the MPC system. This way authorities can request the MPC cluster to reveal a subset of data predefined by smart contracts.

<a name="si"></a>
<a name="2_1_14_self_signer"></a>
#### 2.1.14. `self.signer`

The account address whose private key is used to sign the transaction and decode encrypted records, is called `self.signer`. `self.signer` is always an account address. (As long as federated signature scheme is not introduced in Aleo).

![Self signer](./images/self_caller_self_signer.png)

See [Aleo documentation](https://developer.aleo.org/leo/language#selfcaller) for details.

<a name="sc"></a>
<a name="2_1_15_self_caller"></a>
#### 2.1.15. `self.caller`

The address of an account or a contract that called the transition is called `self.caller`. See figure above for details. 

See [Aleo documentation](https://developer.aleo.org/leo/language#selfcaller) for details.

<a name="2_2_specification_"></a>
### 2.2. Specification 

In this session the transitions, constants, and mappings are defined. Wherever name is specified for a transition, constant, or mapping, it is mandatory to use the specific name and the specific type(s) specified in this ARC. 

<a name="2_2_1_name_of_token_must_be_implemented"></a>
#### 2.2.1. Name of token - MUST BE IMPLEMENTED

`const NAME : field`: the name of the token. Eg: "Aleo Credits"  

A unicode string of byte length of 16. The left most character of string should be the highest byte of the `field` number. As an example "Aleo Credits" must be encoded as follows: `0x416C656F20637265646974730000000000000000000000000000000000000000  = 29591854713254390051098558719843710286620636002170764447558050801690808942592field`. 

Once `string` type is included in Aleo specification, this ARC must be updated.

<a name="2_2_2_symbol_of_token_must_be_implemented"></a>
#### 2.2.2. Symbol of token - MUST BE IMPLEMENTED


`const SYMBOL : field`: the symbol of the token. Eg: "ALEO"  

A unicode string of byte length of 16. The left most character of string should be the highest byte of the `field` number. As an example "ALEO" should be encoded as follows: `0x414C454F00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = 29535093885169187707116277799267314899879263164026335641338301482164084015104field`. 

Once `string` type is included in Aleo specification, this ARC must be updated.

<a name="company_signature"></a>
<a name="2_2_3_company_signature_must_be_implemented"></a>
#### 2.2.3. Company signature - MUST BE IMPLEMENTED

<a name="2_2_3_1_rationale_for_company_signature"></a>
##### 2.2.3.1 Rationale for company signature

Companies that create smart contracts must be able to have a standardized mechanism to connect their contracts to their website. This is a means to minimize fake contracts stealing users funds. It can be realized by the followings:
1. By createing a standardized URL: CAU - Company Addresses URL, that MUST return the JSON array of signer addresses, their validity, and corresponding signatures of the company. 
2. On the smart contract side all contracts MUST HAVE a constant called `COMPANY_SIGNATURE` that MUST BE the signature of the contract name created by the private key of one of the signer addresses in JSON format returned by (1.). 

This way users can check if the contract is belonging to the Company.

Blockhain explorers can utilize this feature to display the website that the contract belongs to. Explorers can request the [CAU](#cau) URL from developer, when the contract is verified, and then display the website of the company to the users. This way users can be sure that the contract is indeed belonging to the certain company.

Wallets can use the same mechanism to check legitimacy of a specific contract the same way explorers can. Wallets can also use this feature to deny interacting with a compromised contract.

<a name="csc"></a>
<a name="2_2_3_2_company_signature_constant_must_be_implemented"></a>
##### 2.2.3.2 Company signature constant - MUST BE IMPLEMENTED

```leo
const COMPANY_SIGNATURE: signature = <signature_literal>;
```

`signature` must be created by Aleo signing scheme the following way:

`signature = aleo::sign_message(<program_name>, pk)`: where 
1. `aleo::sign_message` is the [message signing scheme](https://developer.aleo.org/aleo/language/#signatures) of Aleo.
2. `<program_name>` is the name of the ARC20 token. Eg: "ARC20_0001.aleo". The extension of the program name MUST BE ".aleo".
3. `pk` is the private key of the `account_address` of company. 


<a name="cau"></a>
<a name="2_2_3_3_cau_company_accounts_url_must_be_implemented"></a>
##### 2.2.3.3 CAU - Company Accounts URL - MUST BE IMPLEMENTED

CAU - Company Accounts URL: `https://<company-domain.com>/aleo_signer_accounts/` 

where `<company-domain.com>` is the domain name of the company. 

This URL called upon by the GET method must return a JSON array of objects each containing 
1. `account`: Aleo address whose private keys are used by company to sign its contracts, and 
2. `status`: String that MUST BE one of `active`, `exprired`, and `compromised`.
    1. If account is `active` it means that it is actively propagated by the Company owning CAU and the account is not compromised.
    2. If account is `expired` it means that Company has disowned the contract, and users should treat contract as if it is not belonging to the Company.
    3. If account is `compromised` it means that the private key has been compromised, and Company has disowned the contract, and users should treat contract as if it is not belonging to the Company. 
2. `cau_signature` a signature that connects the CAU to the `account`.

Example return: 

```json

    },
    {
        "account": "aleo17wmuq5n08vs0tt356uhc6hlljy8c95zteqpa2ne8kcw3sa0rt5yqg7jdys",

    }
]
```
To ensure that a contract is indeed belonging to the company, both of the following conditions MUST BE satisfied:

1. Lets assume that from the returned list of accounts an account called `signing_account` does satisfy the following equality:

    `aleo::verify_message(program_name, COMPANY_SIGNATURE, signing_account) == true`: where 
    1. `program_name` is the name of the ARC20 token. Eg: "ARC20_0001.aleo". The extension of the program name MUST BE ".aleo".
    2. [`COMPANY_SIGNATURE`](#csc) is the signature of the `program_name` created by the private key of the `account` address.
    3. `signing_account` is the current address returned by Company Accounts URL. 

    If `signing_account` does indeed satisfy (1.) then there is a mathematical proof that this account indeed has signed the `program_name` program.

2. `cau_signature` belonging to `signing_account` MUST satisfy the `aleo::verify_message(concatenate(cau, status), cau_signature, signing_account) == ture` equation, where 
    1. `cau` is the [CAU - Company Accounts URL](#cau).
    2. `status` is the status of the `signing_account`. 
    2. `cau_signature` is the signature of the CAU created by the private key of the `signing_account` address.
    3. `signing_account` is the `account` that the same as in (1.) above.
`cau_signature` signature ensures that the JSON array of addresses indeed belong to the Company Accounts URL.
    
    If `signing_account` and `cau_signature` do indeed satisfy (2.) then there is a mathematical proof that this account indeed signed the `cau` URL, thus the CAU has legitimately listed the account as its own. This gives protection against sites falsely claiming that `accounts` are theirs.
    
If [`COMPANY_SIGNATURE`](#csc) and none of the returned `account`s and corresponding `cau_signatures` satisfy both (1.) and (2.) then the contract MUST BE considered as not belonging to the company.

IF BOTH (1.) and (2.) are satisfied by [`COMPANY_SIGNATURE`](#csc), `signing_account` and corresponding `cau_signature` then the contract MUST BE considered as belonging to the company.

<a name="2_2_3_4_invalidate_signature_should_be_implemented"></a>
##### 2.2.3.4 Invalidate signature - SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED

To remove signature validity Companies MUST change the `status` field to `expired` of the associated `account` from the CAU JSON array. This way the signature will not be valid anymore. 

<a name="2_2_3_5_change_cau_url_should_be_implemented"></a>
##### 2.2.3.5 Change CAU URL - SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED

In case of rebranding or other reasons Companies CAN change the CAU URL. The `cau_signature` MUST BE updated to sign the new CAU and associate those to `account` addresses in returned JSON array. 

They also should update the CAU with blockchain explorers.

<a name="2_2_3_6_compromised_private_key_of_signing_account_should_be_implemented"></a>
##### 2.2.3.6 Compromised private key of signing `account` - SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED

In case private key of signing `account` is compromised, then the `status` field MUST BE set to `compromised` in the returned JSON array. This way the signature will not be valid anymore. Users of contract should treat the contract as if it is not belonging to the company.

If there is an other website of Hacker not belonging to Company that has stolen the private key of a signing account of Company, and creates a fake site stating that the contract is indeed belonging to the Hacker, then the Company can invalidate the signature by setting the `status` field to `compromised` in the returned JSON array. Explorers in case of contradicting CAU URLs should always use the one that was used previously to avoid the attack of Hacker.

<a name="2_2_4_approve_of_tokens_not_needed"></a>
#### 2.2.4. Approve of tokens - NOT NEEDED

~~`approve(to: address, amount: u64) -> ()`~~ transition is not needed in this design.

Instead of ~~`approve()`~~ transition the [`transfer_from_public()`](#tp) transition should be used. And a signature of that transaction should be created offline beforehand. This setup uses less system resources and thus more scalable then to use ~~`approve()`~~ that would use mappings . 

<a name="2_2_5_allowance_of_tokens_not_needed"></a>
#### 2.2.5. Allowance of tokens - NOT NEEDED

~~`allowance() -> u64`~~ transition is not needed in this design. 

As in the [`transfer_from_public()`](#tp) transition the signature parameter contains the approval. See  [`transfer_from_public()`](#tp) transition above.

<a name="decimals"></a>
<a name="2_2_6_1_decimals_constant_must_be_implemented"></a>
##### 2.2.6.1. Decimals constant - MUST BE IMPLEMENTED

`const DECIMALS : u8`: constant containing the deimal precision of the current token.

<a name="2_2_6_2_decimals_transition_not_needed"></a>
##### 2.2.6.2. Decimals transition - NOT NEEDED
~~`decimals() -> u8`~~: transition returning the decimal precision of the current token.

This transition is not needed as the [`DECIMALS`](#decimals) constant is already defined for the same purpose.

<a name="2_2_6_2_1_rationale_for_not_having_decimals_as_a_transition"></a>
###### 2.2.6.2.1. Rationale for not having decimals as a transition

As `DECIMALS` is a constant  (see [above](#decimals)), and MUST BE IMPLEMENTED, it is easy to query and provide it as input of any transition necessary. There is no need to implement an extra transition for this purpose.

<a name="2_2_7_public_balance_of_account_must_be_implemented"></a>
#### 2.2.7. Public balance of account - MUST BE IMPLEMENTED

`mapping account : address => u64`: the public balance of an account. The `address` is the address of the account. The `u64` is the amount of tokens the account has. 

<a name="2_2_8_private_token_record_must_be_implemented"></a>
#### 2.2.8 Private token record - MUST BE IMPLEMENTED

<a name="private_records_to_contracts"></a>
<a name="2_2_8_1_rationale_of_private_records_being_sent_to_contracts"></a>
##### 2.2.8.1 Rationale of private records being sent to contracts

There are two reasons why private token records should be sent to contracts:
1. To enable private (but compliant) DeFi on Aleo.
2. To enable the scalability of the token system.

Private DeFi is a must have feature for Aleo to be able to compete with other blockchains. 

Scalability can be achived better with records than with mappings. Because with mappings all the validators must rerun the transaction which has `O(n)` difficulty, where `n` is the number of instructions, while with private records it is `O(1)` because all validators have to do is check the validity of a proof. Thus applying records leads to a much more scalable system.  

![Deposit tokens](./images/transfer-to-contract-private.png)
The easiest implementation of sending private tokens to a smart contract would be to just simply set the `owner` field to that of the destination contract (2.). With currernt setup this is not possible as currently contracts do not have a private keys, that would allow them to encode/decode private record data. So in the optimal solution the contract as an `owner` would have two capabilities in one:
1. It would have an address that is authorized to control the record.
2. It would have a private key that can encode and decode the record data.

Currently (2.) is not possible as contracts do not have a federated private key. So the ownership and the encoding/decoding of private data must be separated:
1. The `owner` field of the record will be the address of the [MPC](#mpc) cluster that has the federated private key to encode and decode the private data.
2. The new `contract` field of the record will be the address of the contract that the record is sent to.

The current ARC implementation MUST make sure that [MPC](#mpc) can only operate on record by calling the methods of `contract`. [MPC](#mpc) MUST NOT be able to call transitions of record contract directly. 

This will reflect in the design of the `credits` record. 

<a name="2_2_8_2_design_of_credits_record_must_be_implemented"></a>
##### 2.2.8.2 Design of `credits` record - MUST BE IMPLEMENTED

The `credits` record MUST HAVE three fields instead of just two: 
1. `owner` - private `address`, the owner of the record. This is the account that has the right to encode and decode the private data. If a record is owned by a contract, than this field MUST BE the account address of the [MPC](#mpc) cluster that has the federated private key to encode and decode the private data.
2. `contract` - private `address`, the contract that the record is sent to. If the record is sent to an account, then this field MUST BE [`ZERO_ADDRESS`](#zero_address). If the record is sent to a contract, then this field MUST BE the address of the contract. 
3. `microcredits` - private `u64`, the amount of tokens the record contains. This field MUST BE public.

The record MUST HAVE the following definition:
```
record credits {
    owner: address,
    contract: address,
    microcredits: u64
}
```

If the `contract` field is not [`ZERO_ADDRESS`](#zero_address) then the this token contract MUST only accept calls whose [`self.signer`](#si) is the the `credit.owner` and the [`self.caller`](#sc) is the `credit.contract`. This way only `contract` can control the private record, but the [MPC](#mpc) as the `owner` can encode and decode the private data. 

<a name="2_2_9_token_transfer_transitions_must_be_implemented"></a>
#### 2.2.9. Token transfer transitions - MUST BE IMPLEMENTED

Token transfer transitions are the transitions that can be used to transfer tokens from one account to another. The following transitions are defined in this ARC:
1. transfer from public to private and vice versa,
    1. [`transfer_public_to_private(..)`](#transfer_public_to_private)
    2. [`transfer_private_to_public(..)`](#transfer_private_to_public)
2. that transfers to another account or contract publicly,
    1. [`transfer_public(..)`](#tpa) - transfer to another account
    2. [`transfer_from_public(..)`](#tp) - transfer to a contract
    3. [`hash_to_sign(..)`](#hts) - helper transition to `transfer_from_public()` to create the hash to be signed
3. that transfers to an account or contract privately.
    1. [`transfer_private(..)`](#transfer_private) - transfer to an account
    2. [`transfer_private_contract(..)`](#transfer_private_contract) - transfer to a contract

This transition can only be used to send tokens privately to an account. To transfer tokens privately to a contract, the [`transfer_private_contract()`](#transfer_private_contract) must be used by the receiving contract (for details see [pocedure 2.3.1](#deposit_private)). 

It MUST return a tuple of two records in the order below:
1. Remainder record - the remainder of `credit` that is left for sender after sending `amount` of it to `to` address. It MUST HAVE the following fields set. All of which MUST BE private: 
    1. `owner` private `address`, must be the same as that of the input record `credit`.
    2. `contract`  private `address`, must be the same as that of the input record `credit`.
    3. `microcredits` private `u64`, field MUST BE the remainder of `microcredits` after having spent `amount`;
2. Record sent, with the following fields. All of which MUST BE private:
    1. `owner` private `address`, must be set to `to` address.
    2. `contract` private `address`, if the contract was called 
        1. by an account (`self.caller == self.signer`), then `credit.contract` must be equal to [`ZERO_ADDRESS`](#zero_address) if not transition MUST fail, then [`ZERO_ADDRESS`](#zero_address).
        2. by a contract (`self.caller != self.signer`), then [`self.caller`](#sc)  must be equal to `credit.contract`, or the transaction initiator ([`self.signer`](#si)) must be equal to `credit.owner` and `credit.contract` MUST BE equal to  [`ZERO_ADDRESS`](#zero_address), if not transition MUST fail, then [`self.caller`](#sc).
    3. `microcredits` private `u64`, field MUST BE the amount of `amount` of tokens that was sent.

It MUST be able to transfer tokens to contracts using this transition.

##### 2.2.11.1 Rationale of not having Total Supply mapping in a mandatory way

Maintaining the `total_supply` in a mapping means that for each `mint()` and `burn()` transition this mapping must be updated. And as it is a mapping, it means that all validators must re-run the transaction, which is `O(n)` difficulty, where `n` is the number of instructions in the finalize function. This is much less scalable as if the `total_supply`  is maintained as a record, and each validator only has to check the validity of the proof, which is `O(1)` difficulty. Thus making the contract more scalable.

#### 2.3.1. Deposit private token record to contract

![Deposit tokens](./images/deposit_token.png)

User has an address of `aleo1user`, Smart Contract has a contract address of `aleo1contract`, and [MPC](#mpc) has an account address of `aleo1mpc`. User has a record with the following fields:

```
credit {
    owner: aleo1user,
    contract: ZERO_ADDRESS,
    microcredits: 10M
}
```

Deposit privately works as follows:
1. User calls the Smart Contract's `deposit_private(credit, ...)` transition. (The name (`deposit_private()`) of the transition can be defined by contract developers.)
2. During the execution of `deposit_private()`, the Smart Contract calls the `transfer_private(to: aleo1mpc, amount: 10M, credit: credits)` transition on ARC20 contract using the record provided by user in previous step.
3. ARC20 contract consumes the received `credit` record, and creates a new one with the followings:

```
credit {
    owner: aleo1mpc,
    contract: aleo1contract,
    microcredits: 10M
}
```

This record can not be sent by [MPC](#mpc) to any other contract than `aleo1contract`, because that MUST BE denied by ARC20 contract. [MPC](#mpc) can only send the record to `aleo1contract` and the predefined transitions of `aleo1contract` will limit what can be done with the credit record.

#### 2.3.2. Deposit using `transfer_from_public()` transition

![Transfer To Contract](./images/transfer_to_contract.png)

User can send tokens to a contract publicly the following way:
1. User authorizes the sending of tokens to contract by signing the details of the [`transfer_from_public()`](#tp) transition offline. His steps are as follows:
    1. Create `auth_hash = BHP256::hash_to_field(from, to, amount, expire)` offline, where 
        1. `from` is the user's account address,
        2. `to` is the contracts address,
        3. `amount` is the aonut of tokens he agrees to send to contract,
        4. `expire` is the blocknumber when this authorization exprires.
    2. Signs the hash offline `authorization = aleo.sign(auth_hash, pk)`, Where:
        1. `auth_hash` is the hash created in previous step.
        2. `pk` is the private key of his account address.
2. User calls the `deposit_public(authorization, to, amount, expire, ...)` transition of contract. The name is not defined in this ARC, CAN BE any name the contract's creator wants. Within this transition contract
    1. Checks if `to` is an address where he accepts tokens.
    2. Calls the [`transfer_from_public(authorization, to, amount, self.caller, expire)`](#tp) transition on the token contract, and this way transfers the tokens to himself.

### 2.4. Test Cases

This section should introduce any and all critical test cases that need to be considered for the specification.

<!-- Provide any test vectors that should be included in unit and/or integration tests. -->

<!-- Are there edge cases to be aware of? -->

<!-- Include test code snippets, if possible. -->

## 3. Dependencies

The following components are affected by this standard:
1. `credits.aleo` - MUST BE UPGRADED TO COMPLY TO THIS ARC  
    The program MUST BE updated as defined in this ARC. Upgrading will introduce full contract support for `credits.aleo`  program.
2. leo - BUGFIX NEEDED  
    Current bug in compiler MUST BE FIXED.  
    Compiler currently does not recognize signature literal in the following example:
    ```leo
    const COMPANY_SIGNATURE: signature = sign069ju4e8s66unu25celqycvsv3k9chdyz4n4sy62tx6wxj0u25vqp58hgu9hwyqc63qzxvjwesf2wz0krcvvw9kd9x0rsk4lwqn2acqhp9v0pdkhx6gvkanuuwratqmxa3du7l43c05253hhed9eg6ppzzfnjt06fpzp6msekdjxd36smjltndmxjndvv9x2uecsgngcwsc2qkns4afd;
    ```
    It MUST BE FIXED to accept it.
3. snarkVM - NEW FEATURE REQUEST  
    If snarkVM could introduce global variables next to mappings then `total_supply` would not nave to be a mapping but a global variable. This would make the contract more simple as an unnecessary mapping would not be needed.
    Another option would be to allow the unit type in mappings:
    ```aleo
    mapping total_supply : unit => u64;
    ```

<a name="3_1_backwards_compatibility"></a>
### 3.1. Backwards Compatibility

This standard is backwards compatible with the current version of `credits.aleo` no update is needed for current programs in order to upgrade to new version of `credits.aleo`.

## 4. Security & Compliance

This proposal does not introduce any security concerns that were not already    present in the existing implementation of `credits.aleo`.

This proposal does not introduce any regulatory risk that were not already present in the existing implementation of `credits.aleo`.
