## Abstract

This file serves as the suggested template for new ARC proposals.

We understand that every proposal is different, and the purpose of this template is to help guide you
to ensure your proposal has considered as many aspects as possible.

This section should describe the rationale for this ARC.

<!-- What problem does this proposal address? -->

<!-- If someone only reads this far, what do you want them to know? -->


## Specification

This section should outline the technical requirements and considerations for incorporating this proposal as
a new ARC standard.

<!-- Define key terminology here. -->

<!-- Describe the architecture. -->

<!-- Include process diagrams. -->

### Test Cases

This section should introduce any and all critical test cases that need to be considered for the specification.

<!-- Provide any test vectors that should be included in unit and/or integration tests. -->

<!-- Are there edge cases to be aware of? -->

<!-- Include test code snippets, if possible. ->


## Reference Implementations

This section should contain links to reference implementations that the community can review to evaluate the
quality, complexity, and completeness of the new ARC standard.

<!-- Link to any relevant Github issues. -->

<!-- Link to any related Github branches and/or pull requests. -->


## Dependencies

This section should list the affected products, projects, and repositories that either directly or indirectly
are affected by this ARC proposal.

<!-- Will this affect the Aleo PM, Aleo Explorer, or Aleo Studio? -->

<!-- Will this affect Aleo, Leo, snarkOS, snarkVM, or any other repositories? -->

### Backwards Compatibility

This section should cover any and all backwards incompatibility risks, along with their severity.

<!-- List all backwards incompatibilities and their severity. -->

<!-- How will the backwards incompatibilities be resolved? -->


## Security & Compliance

This section should address any security and regulatory concerns if the ARC proposal were incorporated into Aleo.
If you are uncertain, please don't hesitate to ask the core team on Discord.

<!-- Outline any potential security concerns. -->

<!-- Does this proposal introduce regulatory risk? -->


## References

This section should provide any materials that would help reviewers have better context on the nature of the ARC proposal.

<!-- List any links that would be helpful for context. -->
