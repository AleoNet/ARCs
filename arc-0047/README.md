## Abstract

This ARC proposes establishing a hard cap of **5,000,000,000 Aleo Credits (ALEO)**. The cap will be enforced by halting block rewards and proving rewards at a predetermined block height (based on theoretical maximum issuance).

## Motivation

Under the current Aleo emission schedule, rewards continue indefinitely and total proving emissions are tied directly to network proving activity. This creates several long-term economic challenges:

- **Unbounded inflation** in perpetuity.
- **Limited predictability** around future token supply.
- **Uncertainty for participants** who rely on fixed-supply or capped-supply economic models.

Establishing a 5 billion ALEO maximum supply addresses these issues by providing:

- **Long-term monetary predictability** for the ecosystem.
- **A clearly bounded total supply**, consistent with other fixed-cap digital assets.
- **Stable expectations** for block producers, provers, developers, and users.

## Specification

The Aleo network launched with an initial supply of ~1.5 billion ALEO. All subsequent issuance occurs through block rewards and proving (puzzle) rewards. This ARC does not modify the emission rates of these rewards; instead, it introduces a deterministic point at which both reward streams terminate.

### Deterministic Block Height Cap

We define a block height H such that, even if every block from genesis to **H** paid out the maximum possible proving reward, total issuance could reach, but never exceed **5 billion ALEO**.

- **H = 263,527,685**

At block height **H**, the following MUST occur:

- **Block rewards = 0**
- **Proving rewards = 0**

Because actual proving activity is consistently below the theoretical maximum, **realized supply will almost certainly fall below 5B ALEO** at the cut-off.

Properties of this approach:

- **Simple and deterministic**: No runtime supply checks or tracking are required.
- **Safe under worst-case assumptions**: Even maximum proving throughput cannot push supply above the cap.
- **Implementation-light**: Only a single network upgrade is required.

### Emission Profile

- **Block reward emissions** are expected to produce ~5% annual inflation on the initial 1.5B supply, i.e., roughly 75M ALEO per year.
- **Puzzle reward emissions** vary with proving activity. The emission rate decreases over time and becomes flat at year 9 from genesis.

## Backward Compatibility

This ARC introduces a new cryptoeconomic mechanism and will require a simple network upgrade. Because this change is planned far in the future, it does not require specifying an explicit consensus-version activation. It is sufficient that node operators upgrade at some point within the ~25-year timeframe. In practice, many other consensus upgrades will occur long before then.

## Future Work

Because the changes are not expected to occur until ~Q4 2049, there is flexibility for adjusting the limit height in the future to be more accurate if there are major changes to network assumptions in the future.
